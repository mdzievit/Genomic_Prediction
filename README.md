This repo houses the scripts, input, and output data used to conduct genomic prediction using the Maize Association Population and Ames Diversity Panel.

It is broken out into two sections.

1. Dissertation Version
    - [Download Dissertation](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/17179/)
    - Code
2. The Plant Genome Version
    - [Comprehensive analytical and empirical evaluation of genomic prediction across diverse accessions in maize](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/tpg2.20160)
    - [Code](https://github.com/mdzievit/Genomic_Prediction/tree/master/ThePlantGenome_Version)

Slight modifications were made to the code and analysis between the two versions. Most changes relate to the figures and their overall design and aethestics.
