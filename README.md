## Genomic Prediction via Maize Assocation Population and Ames Diversity Panel

This repo houses the scripts, input, and output data used to conduct genomic prediction using the Maize Association Population and Ames Diversity Panel.

It is broken out into two sections.

1. Dissertation Version
    - [Download Dissertation](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/17179/)
2. The Plant Genome Version (Currently Accepted, waiting to be released)
    - Will update link here once it is availale

Slight modifications were made to the code and analysis between the two versions. Most changes relate to the figures and their overall design and aethestics.
